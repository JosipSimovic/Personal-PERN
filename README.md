# Personal-PERN project -> Webshop App

Personal project using the PERN stack for practice.

Database: PostgreSQL, hosted on ElephantSQL

Frontend: React.js/Redux

Backend: Node.js/Express

## Running the app

For Running the webapp navigate to '/frontend' and run:

```
npm start
```

For running the Node.js server navigate to '/backend' and run:

```
npm start
```

This will run Node.js server with nodemon library.

Or open the webapp directly on the web -> [Webshop App](https://personal-webshop-c37c4.web.app)

The frontend is hosted on Firebase. The backend is hosted on Render using the free plan which shuts down the server when not in use so it might take a while for the initial load when visiting the URL.
